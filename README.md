#Different Models

Yolonet - I learned how to implement Yolov4 object detection on Windows 10 and trained the model to detect chesspieces on a chessboard (provided by Roboflow).
          Installed CUDA, CUDNN, OpenCV. Learned how to use Powershell and Command Prompt. Learned how to modify cfg, data, names and train files.
